    <h1>CSS Layout Rules</h1>

    <div id="width">This div element has width: 700px.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="maxwidth">This div element has max-width: 700px.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="fixed">This div element has position: fixed.</div>
    
    <div id="relative">This div element has position: relative. It has been moved 60px to the right.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="ancestor">
        The div element below is positioned relative to this
        div element since it is the nearest positioned ancestor.
        <div id="absolute">This div element has position: absolute.</div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="overflow">
        The div element below demonstrates sticky position.
        <div id="sticky">This div element has position: sticky.</div>
        The text in this div element is too long to fit in the container. A scrollbar
        is added so the user can scroll through and read the contents. If the overflow
        property was set to hidden, you would not be able to see any of the text that
        overflows outside of the container.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="textForFloat">
        <p><img id="floatRight" src="images/gif.webp">
        This image demonstrates the property float: left.
        When there is text and an image within the same element,
        The float property can help you position the image to the left or right.
        I also used relative positioning to move the image 10px up from where it was.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div id="floatClear">flaoting div</div>
    <div id="clear">Here, clear: left; moves this div down below the floating div.</div>
    <br>
    <div id="verticalAlign">This text is horizontally and vertically centered using text align and padding.</div>
</body>

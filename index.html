        <h4>A Little About Me:</h4>
        <p>My name is Krystal, I just began my CST journey at BCIT! I have no previous programming or computer experience, but 
            am eager and excited to learn. Before entering this program, I worked in the hospitality industry for over 5
            years. I'm looking forward to using the social and interpersonal skills I've gained to compliment everything I will be
            learning in this program! </p>
